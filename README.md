# 🌾 Paddy Disease Classifier

This project is a **Paddy Leaf Disease Detection System** built using **Streamlit** and **Deep Learning** techniques. The web app allows users to upload images of paddy leaves, and it classifies the disease affecting the plant using a pre-trained model.

## 📖 Project Overview

Paddy, being a critical crop in many countries, often gets affected by various diseases which reduce yield and quality. This project helps farmers and researchers detect diseases early by analyzing leaf images and identifying the type of disease.

The model is integrated into a simple and interactive Streamlit web interface for easy accessibility and use.

## 🎥 Demo

> Coming soon — you can deploy it on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or host it locally.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload an image of a paddy leaf.
- Automatically detect and classify the disease.
- Shows the prediction result instantly.
- Built with user-friendly UI using Streamlit.
- Fast inference using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## 🛠 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/Bharath9542530187/paddy-disease




🧬 Model Details
The model was trained to classify common paddy leaf diseases.

It uses a deep learning model (ResNet / CNN or similar) trained on a labeled dataset of paddy leaf images.

The model outputs the name of the disease based on the input image.

The actual training script and dataset are not included in this repo. The app uses a pre-trained model file.
